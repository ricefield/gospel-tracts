> As Jesus made his way through the throngs of people surrounding him, he suddenly stopped and asked, &ldquo;Who touched Me?&rdquo;

It seemed obvious to His disciples, so they answered that it was the crowds pressing upon Him. But Jesus insisted, &ldquo;Someone touched Me.&rdquo; He knew a particu- lar someone had touched Him, because at that mo- ment, divine power had gone out of Him.

A woman stepped out of the crowd and confessed to Jesus that it was she who had deliberately touched Him, and something wonderful had happened to her.

For twelve long years she had been suffering from an uncontrollable hemorrhage, year after year losing more blood. She had seen many physicians and spent all that she had, but nothing helped. She knew she was dying. Then she heard about Jesus. Desperately making her way through the crowd, she came close enough to touch Him, believing that if she touched even just His garment, she would be healed. And as she touched Him, her flow of blood stopped. His divine power had been transfused into her. With lovingkind- ness Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be well from your affliction.&rdquo;

This woman is a picture of all of us, showing that we too are afflicted with a disease that will eventually issue in death&mdash;the inward disease of sin. How much suffering and damage this sickness has caused us! Try as we might, we cannot get rid of it. Nothing can cure us&mdash;no moral philosophy, self-help program, or good works. Instead, our frail and limited life is leaking away. One day it will run out completely. We need the healing of Jesus and His life to save us.

Jesus is the very God who became an approachable and even touchable man to be our Savior. He not only came near to us, but as a sinless man, He died on the cross for our sins. The Bible tells us that He &ldquo;Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree, in order that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness; by whose bruise you were healed&rdquo; (1 Pet. 2:24). His redeeming death heals us of our affliction. Not only so, He resurrected. Today the Lord Jesus is waiting for us to touch Him in order to receive His redemption and His unlim- ited, death-conquering life.

Being content merely to hear about Jesus or to be among the crowd around Him will not save us. If we come to Him in faith and touch Him by believing in what He has done for us, He will heal us and impart His eternal life into us. We will have peace.

You can touch Him in faith right now. Just pray this simple prayer:

> **&ldquo;Lord Jesus, I need You. I am a sinner. I believe in all You did for me on the cross. Thank you for dying for me so I could be healed. Save me now. I receive You as my Savior and my life. Amen.&rdquo;**
