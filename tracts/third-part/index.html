> Have you ever felt unsatisfied, let down, even inexplicably empty, after you got what you thought would make you happy?

You’re not alone. This perplexing feeling has been known to strike the most accomplished and wealthy people as well as the less accomplished and less wealthy. In fact, King Solomon had it all—a kingdom, untold wealth, and profound wisdom and knowledge—yet after pondering his life, he said that there was nothing new under the sun, and that everything was vanity.

It’s as if something compels us to find the elusive missing piece that would bring lasting satisfaction. We may pursue a successful career, meaningful relationships, material possessions, or fun and entertainment. But nothing cures that mysterious empty feeling way down inside. Why do we feel this way?

It turns out that to have this sensation is to be human.

The Bible shows us that God created us in a certain way. We can easily realize we have a body, the part of our being that enables us to contact the physical world. But we’re not just a physical being made up of so many atoms. We also have a soul, an inward part that enables us to experience things in the psycho- logical realm. This, however, isn’t all there is to us.

First Thessalonians 5:23 says, “May your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete.” It is clear that besides our body and soul, God made every human being with a third part—our spirit—the deepest and most hidden part. This God-designed third part has a specific capability: our spirit can contact, receive, and experience God. Because He is the intended content, our spirit can’t be satisfied with anything other than God Himself.

The famous French scientist and mathematician Blaise Pascal said that within mankind is a “God-shaped vacuum.” Only God can fit into this vacuum. As long as our spirit is empty, without God, we cannot obtain true satisfaction; only He can answer the longing of our third part. When God gets into our spirit, He fills its aching emptiness with Himself as our real enjoyment, wealth, and meaning. We are finally and lastingly satisfied with the eternal and divine life of God.

God took some monumental steps so that He could enter our spirit. He became a man named Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a perfect human life on the earth, died to take away our sins, was buried, and then rose from the dead. When He resurrected, He became a life-giving Spirit and can now enter our human spirit. He is waiting for you to open to Him.

You can be filled in this third part—your God-created spirit—right now. Just turn your heart to God and pray this simple prayer:

> **&#x201c;Lord Jesus, I believe in You. I confess that I am a sinner. Forgive me of all my sins. I open to You. Come into my spirit and fill me with Yourself. Lord Jesus, I receive You. Thank You, Lord. Amen.&#x201d;**
