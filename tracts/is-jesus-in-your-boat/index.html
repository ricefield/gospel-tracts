# Is Jesus In Your Boat?

> John 6:16-21 is an account of an event that happened two thousand years ago, yet we can all relate to it today.

The night was dark. Jesus’ disciples were alone in the middle of a rolling sea. The wind was blowing, the waves were tossing their boat, and there was no land in sight. For all their arduous rowing, they had advanced only three or four miles. To reach the destination seemed humanly impossible.

Such a setting depicts the all too familiar condi- tions of our human life. Most of us would have to agree that we are often beset with problems— relationship problems, family problems, school problems, work problems, financial problems, health problems, and so on.

Our troubles are like the churning of the sea. Yet, if that had been the end of the disciples’ story, we also would be the most hopeless of people— putting on a brave front while struggling on, all the while inwardly aching, worn out, and discouraged.

Into such a situation of darkness and despair, Jesus came walking on the sea and approached the boat. He is the unique One who can walk on the stormy sea of human life, ruling over all the waves. All the troubles are under His feet.

You may be afraid of Jesus, just as His dis- ciples were when they first saw Him walking on the water. But then He spoke to them—“It is I. Do not be afraid.”

The story continues: “Then they were willing to take Him into the boat; and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.”

These words continue to be good news to us today. The Lord Jesus wants to come into our turbulent life as the One who can give us peace and bring us safely on our journey. We, just as the disciples did, simply need to take Him into our boat, our life.

As you struggle to row against the churning sea, Christ is here, waiting for you to take Him in. You can invite the Lord Jesus in right now. Just open your heart and pray this simple prayer:


> **&#x201c;Lord Jesus, I need You! Thank You for coming as a lowly man to this troubled world. Thank You for dying for me. Forgive me of all my sins. Lord Jesus, I believe into You, and I receive You right now. Fill me with Yourself as peace and be with me on my life’s journey. Thank You, Lord Jesus. Amen.&#x201d;**
